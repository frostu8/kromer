A cool Discord bot for cool servers.

Discord is an open, free platform. So why should we continue paying to make our
Discord servers the best they can be? A good bot should be open and free, just
like the platform, and that's what this aims to be.

If you're not a developer and care only for the bot itself, you can
[invite it here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=895420881696849920&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands).
But if you **are** a user, keep in mind that this bot is not only unfinished,
but this idea is so unbelieveably unoriginal that there are
[a whole bunch of better alternatives](https://github.com/jacc/awesome-discord).
My personal favorite is [blargbot](https://blargbot.xyz/), but that's an
opinion from a Rust programmer, so take it with a grain of salt and do what you
need to do to make your server a good one.

Features:

* **Server levelling system**  
  Send messages to increase your Kromer balance, and compare yourself with
  others to see who's the most active member.
* **Reaction roles**  
  Allow members to self-assign themselves some roles through a reaction on a
  message.
* **Up-to-date with the latest Discord trends**  
  The Discord developers were nice enough to give bots a whole bunch of tools
  that make bots feel like an *integration* rather than a *hack*, and this bot
  intends on using all of those features. Users shouldn't have to enable
  Developer Mode to setup reaction roles.
* **Powered by Rust and built with Twilight**  
  Rust is an insanely fast systems language, and Twilight is a no-compensations
  Discord library. Nothing stopping you from throwing this up on a Raspberry Pi
  and hosting possibly hundreds of servers... *probably*.
